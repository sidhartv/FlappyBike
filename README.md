# FlappyBird
Bike your way to help Faby make his way through the pipe maze that he unfortunately found himself in. Arduino reads in values from Hall effect sensors mounted on a pedal apparatus which detect the rotation of the pedals. The rotation speed is reported via serial to the Python game, which uses this speed to control the altitude of the bird.

Project done as a part of Build18, an Electrical and Computer Engineering hackathon and Carnegie Mellon.
